\f0\fs24 \cf0 Simulation Study for assessing testing procedures in \
\'93Assessing exposure-time treatment effect heterogeneity in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials\'94 \
\
Contact: Lara Maleyeff, lmaleyeff@g.harvard.edu\
\
This project runs a simulation study of a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (CRT) with exposure time heterogeneity based on\
Model 5 with a binary outcome outcome. We then perform 3 tests: (1) LR Test based on Model 4, (2) LR test based on Model 5, and (3)\
Proposed permutation test based on Model 5. The simulations run in parallel on 10 cores and require gcc/7.1.0 and R/4.0.5.\
\
The required packages are: \
* foreach\
* doParallel\
* lme4\
* emdbook\
* dplyr\
* tidyr\
\
To run: \
sbatch bash.sh n.t sd.expt.ranef sd.n.cl\
Example: sbatch bash.sh 8 30 0 simulates a stepped wedge CRT with 8 clusters and 30 time periods, equal number of individuals at each cluster-time period\
\
\
Files:\
\
* main.R: The main code of the simulation study. Generates a stepped wedge CRT based on Model 5 and runs three tests. Outputs results to \'93results\'94 folder.}
