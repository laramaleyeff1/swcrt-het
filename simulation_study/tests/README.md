<!-- ABOUT  -->
## About The Project

This folder contains the simulation code and results for the testing simulations in “Assessing exposure-time treatment effect heterogeneity in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials.” We also provide the code to create the simulation tables and figures shown in the paper. 

This project runs a simulation study of a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (CRT) with exposure time heterogeneity based on Model 5 with a binary outcome outcome. We then perform 3 tests: (1) LR Test based on Model 4, (2) LR test based on Model 5, and (3) Proposed permutation test based on Model 5. The simulations run in parallel on 10 cores and require gcc/7.1.0 and R/4.0.5.
